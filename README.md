This section tells the tale of development. If you just want to know what technology is used, jump down to the bottom of the page and scroll up a bit.

#### Sprint 1 (Saturday - Tuesday)
###### The Plan: 
Wireframe and have all functionality that the code needs to work even if it's not usable or pretty.

###### The Execution:
The Old-idea was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of its burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. The developer signed it. And the developer's name was good upon 'change for anything she chose to put her hand to. The Old-idea was as dead as a doornail.

**The weekend** was spent searching for public APIs and brainstorming what to build. After discovering the 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons API, I thought of what I would want from this wealth of information and what has been lacking from the free apps I've encountered. Having recently wresled with choosing spells for a new character, I decided to make an application that would allow me to access the spells of a specific character (and only that character). The rest of the weekend was spent trying to scale back what I want to accomplish in this app so that I have a reasonable MVP with good potential to grow.

**Monday** was spent importing my auth-boilerplate, wrangling with git, and database set up.



#### Sprint 2 (Wednesday and Thursday)
###### The Plan: 
MVP(functionality and basic styling)

###### The Execution:

#### Sprint 3 (Friday - Monday)
###### The Plan:
Finish the Readme, additional styling, and implementation of stretch goals.

###### The Execution:
